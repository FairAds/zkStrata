# Prerequisites
In order to execute the examples of zkStrata, the prerequisites below are required. 

## zkStrata Compiler
The zkStrata compiler can be built as JAR from this project, by running:

```
mvn package
```

The executable JAR is built into `target/zkstrata.jar`. For usage information check:

```
java -jar zkstratac.jar --help
```

## bulletproofs_gadgets
[bulletproofs-gadgets](https://github.com/MarcKloter/bulletproofs_gadgets) utilizes the [Bulletproofs](https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/) implementation by [dalek-cryptograph](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs) to execute the intermediate representation generated by the zkStrata compiler.

The binaries of the [bulletproofs-gadgets repository](https://github.com/MarcKloter/bulletproofs_gadgets) can be built using:
```
cargo build --bins --release
```

Or, alternatively, the binaries can directly be run using:
```
cargo run --bin prover <name>
cargo run --bin verifier <name>
```

## OpenSSL
To verify signatures, the examples provide `.pem` and `.crt` files that can be checked using OpenSSL. 

Check the [OpenSSL repository](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) for installation instructions.
